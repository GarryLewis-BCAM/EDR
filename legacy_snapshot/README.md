# Legacy Snapshot (Read-Only)

This directory contains a sanitized snapshot of the previous "hybrid-edr" codebase.

Rules:
- Nothing in this directory is imported or executed.
- It is reference-only for audit and selective extraction.
- Secret-bearing files (config/.env/ssl/data) are intentionally excluded.
